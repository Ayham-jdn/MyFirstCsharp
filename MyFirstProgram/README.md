# Simple Bank Account System – C# Learning Project

My very first small C# program! 🖥️💡  

It simulates a **simple bank system** with:

- Deposit 💰  
- Withdraw 💸  
- Transfer 🔄  
- Bank statement 📄 (transaction history)

---

## Why I made it

I wrote this while learning **classes and object-oriented programming in C#**.  
It was a small project to practice creating objects, methods, and keeping track of state.

## How it works

- Create bank accounts with balance, currency, and account number  
- Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers  
- Print bank statements to see history  

---

## Notes

- **Frontend:** Console only  
- **Purpose:** Learning and memory, not production  
- Shows how I **started coding in C#** and experimented with OOP concepts
